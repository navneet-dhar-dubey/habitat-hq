# Habitat HQ - Residential Society Management Portal

Habitat HQ is a full-stack web application built with Django, designed to streamline the management and communication within residential societies and apartment complexes. This platform provides a centralized system for administrators, residents, and security personnel to manage community-related tasks efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features

This application is being built with a modular approach, focusing on core functionalities that solve real-world problems for a residential community.

* **Role-Based Access Control:** A robust system with distinct roles and permissions for different types of users:
    * **Admin:** Full control over the society, user management, and site-wide settings.
    * **Resident:** Access to community features, personal unit information, and complaint lodging.
    * **Security:** Access to visitor management and security-related modules.

* **Society & Unit Management:** Admins can easily define the structure of the society, including buildings and individual units (flats/apartments).

* **Custom User Model:** A flexible user model built from Django's `AbstractUser` allows for easy expansion of user profiles.

* **Centralized Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard that displays relevant information based on the logged-in user's role.
